Approach:

For this assignment, I used Python to scrape the retail store locations and coordinates data from the websites of various retail brands. I used the requests library to make HTTP requests to the website, and then parsed the response text using the json library. I then used the csv library to write the data to a CSV file.

The approach involved analyzing the website's network traffic using the browser developer tools to identify the API endpoint and parameters used for retrieving the store location data. I then used Python to mimic the network request and retrieve the data in a JSON format. I then extracted the relevant data and saved it in a CSV file for further analysis.
